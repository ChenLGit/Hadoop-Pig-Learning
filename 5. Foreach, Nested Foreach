------ Nested Foreach ------
Foreach can also apply a set of relational operations to each record in your pipeline called nested/inner foreach.

Example:
-- Find number of unique stock symbols for each exchange in the NYSE_daily data
-- distinct_symbols.pig
daily = LOAD 'NYSE_daily' AS (exchange, symbol); 
grpd = group daily by exchange;
uniqcnt = FOREACH grpd { 
          sym = daily.symbol; 
          uniq_sym = DISTINCT sym; 
          GENERATE group, COUNT(uniq_sym);
          };

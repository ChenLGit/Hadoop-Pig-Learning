------ Cross Product ------
Let us create m x n cross products of the m records from one data set and the n records from another.
Can create an enormous amount of data!

Example:
  stocks = LOAD ‘…’ AS (exchange, …);
  divs = LOAD ‘…’ AS (exchange, …);
  stocks_divs = CROSS stocks, divs;
  DESCRIBE stocks_divs
  
  stocks_divs: {stocks::exchange, … divs:: exchange,..}

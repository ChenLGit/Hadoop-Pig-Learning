------ Union ------
The union is used to put two data sets together by CONCATENATING them instead of joining them.
*** More Flexible than SQL Union
Example:
A = LOAD '/user/me/data/files/input1';
B = LOAD '/user/someoneelse/info/input2';
C = UNION A, B;

--- Consider union with same schema ---
A = LOAD 'input1' AS (x:int, y:float);
B = LOAD 'input2' AS (x:int, y:float);
C = UNION A, B;
DESCRIBE C;

C: {x:int, y:float}

--- Different Schema but can reconcile field types ---
A = LOAD 'input1' AS (x:int, y:float);
B = LOAD 'input2' AS (x:int, y:double);
C = UNION A, B;
DESCRIBE C;

C: {x:int, y:double}

--- If canâ€™t reconcile field types ---
A = LOAD 'input1' AS (x:int, y:float);
B = LOAD 'input2' AS (x:int, y:chararray);
C = UNION A, B;
DESCRIBE C;

Schema for C unknown.

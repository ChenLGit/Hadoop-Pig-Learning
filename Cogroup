------ Cogroup ------
The cogroup is a generalization of group. It collects records of n inputs based on the same key.
The result is a record with a key and one bag for each input.

Example:
A = LOAD 'input1' as (id:int, val:float);
B = LOAD 'input2' as (id:int, val2:int);
C = COGROUP A BY id, B BY id;
DESCRIBE C;
  C: {Group; int, A: {id: int, val: float}, B: {id: int, val2: int}}

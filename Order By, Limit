------ Order By ------
Used ORDER… BY to sort the records in a bad(very much like SQL)
– Default order is ascending. Add DESC sorts desending
– Data is sorted based on the types of the indicated fields:
numeric values are sorted numerically, chararray fields are sorted lexically
--- Syntax
Bag2 = Order Bag1 By field [DESC];


------ Practice ------
-- print the top 50 gain stocks and dates
-- set DEFAULT PARALLEL 100;

-- run from the local mode 
daily = LOAD '/home/hadoop/Documents/exercise/NYSE_daily.txt' as (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray,  date:chararray, open:float, high:float, low:float, close:float, volume:int, adj_close:float); --using PigStorage('\t');
daily_sub = FOREACH daily GENERATE symbol, date, (close - open) as gain; 
-- Generate a new table with three columns named "symbol", "data", "(close - open)"
ordered = ORDER daily_sub BY gain DESC;
Top_N = LIMIT ordered 50;
DUMP Top_N;


-- run from the cluster mode 
daily = LOAD '/pig/input/NYSE_daily.txt' as (exchange:chararray, symbol:chararray,  date:chararray, open:float, high:float, low:float, close:float, volume:int, adj_close:float); --using PigStorage('\t');
daily_sub = FOREACH daily GENERATE symbol, date, (close - open) as gain; 
ordered = ORDER daily_sub BY gain DESC;
Top_N = LIMIT ordered 50;
DUMP Top_N;


-- filter 
-- filt_sub = FILTER daily BY symbol = 'CME';
-- DUMP filt_sub;

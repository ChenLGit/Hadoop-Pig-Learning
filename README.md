#Pig (Script Language)
--- Flexible for expressing complicated data flows;
--- Does not require schema definitions;
--- Great for transforming and cleaning raw data before it is used by other systems

• Pros
– Complex data transformations.
– Data cleansing and ETL (extract, transform, load)
– Customizable: file/data formats, UDFs (piggybank)
• Cons
– Non‐SQL Pig is a barrier to SQL users

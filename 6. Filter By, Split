------ Filter ------
-- Removes data if it does not match some criteria
    – This could be a basic expression or a compound expression that looks at multiple fields
    – Predicates can contain the equality operators you expect, including == to test equality, and !=, >, >=, <, and <=

Bag2 = FILTER Bag1 BY expression;

-- GOOG and other stock data
GOOG = FILTER stocks BY symbol == ‘GOOG’
not = FILTER stocks BY symbol != ‘GOOG’
  – Comparisons can be used for all scalar types
  – For tuples and maps, just == and !=
  
-- For chararrays, users can test to see whether the chararray matches a Regular Expression:
GOOG = FILTER stocks BY symbol matches ‘GOO.*’
not = FILTER stocks BY not symbol matches ‘GOO.*’

------ Split ------
Partition in to several relations (GPA High and low)
A = LOAD ‘input_path/file’ as (name:chararray, age:int, gpa:float);
GPA_high = FILTER A by gpa>=3.5;
GPA_mid = FILTER A by 2.5 <=gpa AND gpa<3.5;
GPA_low = FILTER A by gpa<2.5;
****** A simpler way to write this… ******
SPLIT Bag1 INTO bag2 IF expression, bag3 if expression [,…]
example:
SPLIT A INTO GPA_high IF gpa>=3.5, GPA_mid IF gpa>=2.5 AND gpa<3.5, GPA_low IF gpa<2.5;
